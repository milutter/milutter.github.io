<b>Bio:</b> Michael Lutter is a Ph.D. student with <a href="https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/JanPeters">Jan Peters</a> 
at the <a href="https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/">Institute for Intelligent 
Autonomous Systems (IAS) TU Darmstadt</a> since July 2017. During his Ph.D., he researched inductive biases for robot
learning. Michael focused on whether inductive biases are preferable for learning algorithms and how inductive biases
can be incorporated in generic deep learning algorithms. He showed that (1) inductive biases can drastically improve sample
efficiency for robot learning and (2) that generic inductive biases can be incorporated in deep learning models to obtain
interpretable and physically plausible models. Michael also worked with ABB Corporate Research on a joint research project
to evaluate the application of robot learning to industrial applications. He completed a research internship at NVIDIA Research
and received multiple awards for his research including the 
<a href="https://ki50.de/ki-newcomer/">AI newcomer award (2019)</a>  
of the German computer science foundation and  was 
<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/02/17/nvidia-phd-fellowships-gpu-computing-research/">NVIDIA graduate fellowship finalist (2019)</a>.

Prior to this Michael held a researcher position at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) for bio-inspired learning 
for robotics. During this time he worked for the Neurorobotics subproject of the 
<a href="https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/">Human Brain Project</a>, a European H2020 FET flagship project. In 
addition, he taught the classes "Deep Learning for Autonomous Systems” and  “Fundamentals of Computer Science for 
Neuroengineering” within the <a href="http://www.msne.ei.tum.de/en/home/">Elite Master Programm Neuroengineering</a> 
and participated in teaching <a href="https://www.thinkmakestart.com/">Think. Make. Start.</a>, a two-week prototyping course. 
His educational background covers a Bachelors in Engineering Management from University of Duisburg Essen and a Masters 
in Electrical Engineering from the Technical University of Munich. During his undergraduate studies he also spent one 
semester at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology studying electrical engineering and computer science. In addition 
to his studies, Michael worked for ThyssenKrupp, Siemens and General Electric and received multiple scholarships for 
academic excellence.
