<b>Bio:</b> Michael Lutter is a research scientist at <a href="https://www.bostondynamics.com/">Boston Dynamics</a>. 
Within the Atlas team, he works on applying reinforcement learning to legged locomotions. Prior, he completed his Ph.D.
supervised by <a href="https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/JanPeters">Jan Peters</a> at the 
<a href="https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/">Institute for Intelligent Autonomous Systems (IAS) TU Darmstadt</a>
in November 2021. During his Ph.D., he researched inductive biases for robot learning. Michael also worked with ABB 
Corporate Research on a joint research project to evaluate the application of robot learning to industrial applications.
He completed a research internship at DeepMind, NVIDIA Research and received multiple awards for his research including the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Giralt_PhD_Award">George Giralt Ph.D. Award (2022)</a>
for the best robotics Ph.D. thesis in Europe and the <a href="https://ki50.de/ki-newcomer/">AI newcomer award (2019)</a>  
of the German computer science foundation.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
From 2016 to 2017, Michael held a researcher position at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) for bio-inspired learning 
for robotics. During this time he worked for the Neurorobotics subproject of the 
<a href="https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/">Human Brain Project</a>, a European H2020 FET flagship project. In 
addition, he taught the classes "Deep Learning for Autonomous Systems” and  “Fundamentals of Computer Science for 
Neuroengineering” within the <a href="http://www.msne.ei.tum.de/en/home/">Elite Master Programm Neuroengineering</a> 
and participated in teaching <a href="https://www.thinkmakestart.com/">Think. Make. Start.</a>, a two-week prototyping course. 
His educational background covers a Bachelors in Engineering Management from University of Duisburg Essen and a Masters 
in Electrical Engineering from the Technical University of Munich. During his undergraduate studies he also spent one 
semester at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology studying electrical engineering and computer science. In addition 
to his studies, Michael worked for ThyssenKrupp, Siemens and General Electric and received multiple scholarships for 
academic excellence.
