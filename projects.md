I work on inductive biases for robot learning. Within this field I focus on whether inductive biases are preferable for 
learning algorithms and how inductive biases
can be incorporated in generic deep learning algorithms. I showed that (1) inductive biases can drastically improve sample
efficiency for robot learning and (2) that generic inductive biases can be incorporated in deep learning models to obtain
interpretable and physically plausible models.
